                The inspiration behind “SecondLife Solutions Mumbai” emerged from our personal experiences. My older
                brother would walk up the stairs to his class every day, and notice a large pile of <span id="words">lost items</span>, that
                increased by the day. He would come home and tell us about this. As 11 year olds, we began to notice it
                too. But what we also saw was that nothing was being done with this.
               <br> Through our lives, my mother has had a very strong passion for the <span id="words">environment</span>, that has passed onto us.
                Seeing these items without a purpose got us thinking about the environmental consequences of these. Why
                was it fair, that an item that had been lost could not have <span id="words">another life?</span>That it was perfectly good,
                but could not be used another time? The wastage just never stopped.
                <br>And then, we looked at the social aspect of this. <span id="words">15 crore</span> children in India don’t have access
                to stationary, clothes, basic items that we lose in those piles. So we thought, why not connect the two?
                Why not take this unclaimed lost property, clean it up, and send it to the NGO’s so children like us
                could have the same resources?
                <br>This started out with my brother leading collections at our school, every three months. As he graduated,
                he passed the initiative down to me.
                <br>Now, we have expanded to over <span id="words">15 schools</span> in Mumbai, and over <span id="words">10 NGO's</span> !
